# Intro

Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects up to 5% of adults. It’s an often misunderstood condition that can significantly affect one’s personal and professional life. I’m excited to share insights from a career full of highs and lows managing Adult ADHD and some tools for anyone, ADHD or not, interested in improving their productivity.

## What is ADHD?

>_“A lifelong, persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development across time and settings.”_

* Was described as “ADD” in DSM-III in 1980
* Formally defined as “ADHD” in DSM-IV in 1994
* Current definition has 3 subtypes: **Predominantly Inattentive**, **Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive**, and **Combined Presentation**
* The condition onsets in childhood. Up to 5% of children may meet the diagnostic criteria. 1/3 to 2/3 of children diagnosed will continue to exhibit symptoms through adulthood.

* There is clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or reduce the quality of, social, academic, or occupational functioning.
* The symptoms do not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., mood disorder, anxiety disorder, dissociative disorder, personality disorder, substance intoxication or withdrawal).

* Poor self-management relative to time, planning, and goals
* Poor self-organization, problem solving, and working memory
* Poor self-discipline (inhibition)
* Poor self-motivation
* Poor self-activation, concentration, and alertness

# Comorbidities

* Depression
* Anxiety
* Oppositional Defiant Disorder (and Conduct Disorder)

# Imposter Syndrome

* A feeling that any success or achievement is due to luck and not one's own talent or effort
* A persistent fear of being exposed as a "fraud"
* A feeling that you "don't belong here"

Remember: _actual_ imposters almost never suffer from imposter syndrome.

You can do the hard thing!

^ This is a HUGE thing in tech!

^ Pattern of failure -> low self-esteem

^ These feelings of inadequacy can linger despite significant evidence to the contrary

---

# Causes of ADHD

* There’s no scientific consensus on a single cause
* Research points to a heavily genetic component; there’s evidence for environmental factors as well
* Predominant theory: dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmitters don’t work the same way a neurotypical brain does, so we don’t receive the standard reward feedback for accomplishing tasks

^ Discuss myths: sugar, caffeine, the teevee, that dang rock music that all the kids listen to

^ Reward feedback loop

---

# How does this affect my life?

* Work
* Relationships
* Finances
* Health

^ Work: Intelligent but underperformed in school, Project an incorrect professional perception, Taking all day to complete a 15 minute task, Procrastinating and poor planning, Inflating progress during standup

^ Relationships: Forgetting important dates and info, giving the perception of ignoring or undervaluing significant other

^ Finance: Forgetting bills, poor money planning due to impulsivity

^ Health: Poor diet due to lack of planning and impulsiveness, failing to follow through long term with plans, putting off or forgetting doctor appts

---

# If you’re not sure: get a professional diagnosis

Your primary care physician can refer you to a licensed clinician, such as a neurologist or psychiatrist

These tests can be long, stressful, and expensive, but is the only way to be officially diagnosed

^ Everyone experiences these symptoms in a limited capacity. It reaches the level of a diagnosable illness if it's chronic, pervasive, and negatively affects your quality of life

# Management strategies and mitigation techniques

![](aravind-vijayan-534010-unsplash.jpg)

---

# Professional treatment

* Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
* ADHD Coaching
* Medication

^ CBT focuses on improving habits and behavior by practicing healthy coping mechanisms

---

# Medication

* Stimulant: Adderall, Ritalin, Concerta, Vyvanse
* Non-stimulant: Strattera, Clonidine, Guanfacine
* Everyone reacts differently to different medications
* Work with your doctor to find what works for you

^ Stimulant meds trick the brain into producing chemicals at a rate much closer to that of neurotypical brains. Many of us already self-medicate with caffeine!

^ Side effects include lack of appetite, restlessness, mild euphoria, small potential for abuse if not used as indicated by doctor

^ Non-stimulant medications help by boosting norepinephrine, decreasing impulsivity – less risk of abuse, take longer to work

^ There is no single drug that works for everyone! Figuring out drug/dosage is a process with your doc

---

# Non-medication treatment

Exercise, sleep, and good nutrition can help but do not represent a comprehensive treatment plan by themselves

---

# Optimize your work

* Find roles that leverage your strengths and minimize your weaknesses
* Our brains thrive on novelty, not routine

^ It could be our strengths are more aligned to reactive work instead of proactive work - Ops, Support, etc. Or we may be good at big picture architecture rather than routine bugfixes

---

# Be honest with yourself!

* Taking on too much leads to a cycle of overpromise/underdeliver and instills a sense of hopelessness and failure
* Look at your previous successes and failures and your work throughput. Use that to give yourself a baseline of what you can reasonably commit to.
* Give yourself buffer time to deliver your commitments. 2 story points but you’re not confident in the implementation details yet? Make it 3 or 5.
* Consistently delivering commitments on time–even if it’s less than you think you might be capable of–will give you confidence and develop your reputation.

---

# Time management strategies

* Pomodoro, timeboxing, pair programming
* Browser extensions/apps to disable or eliminate distractions (email, social media)
* Physical planner

^ We're bad at time management, and any system we use to fix that needs to take that into account

---
[.build-lists: false]
# Organizational tools

* OneNote, Evernote, G-suite, Trello, Workflowy, Airtable, Todoist, Notion.so
* CLI tools
* Physical notebook w/ pen

Don't be afraid to evaluate different tools to figure out what works for _you_.

^ Take notes constantly, this can make all the difference. Don't be afraid to invest lots of "overhead" time into writing and reviewing notes

^ Story of taking notes and being always prepared at Sorenson when asked for info

---

# Workspace changes

* Darker dev environment (Eliminate visual distractions)
* Dark UI, IDE
* Quiet space/headphones
* Work with team to establish optimum communication channels

---

# Communication with management and team

* ADA legally protects “reasonable accommodation” requests
* Can ask for shorter feedback cycles
* Detailed acceptance criteria
* Communications in whatever manner works best for your cognition and retention (face to face/conference calls/group chat/email)
* Don’t be afraid to ask for help!
* Ask about mentorships (a great resource for a professional at any stage in their career!)
* **Caveat:** professional risk

^ Being upfront about your needs can be reassuring to your team and supervisor

^ Can project a sense of laziness or casualness that doesn't describe the real you

^ Some people believe it doesn’t exist/is an excuse for laziness

---

![fit](twosides.jpg)

^ We have cognitive challenges that affect our lives, but they can also be a source of our unique creative power

^ We're patient, empathetic, and compassionate; able to see big picture ideas, be passionate about what drives us

^ You can do the hard thing!
